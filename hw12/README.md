# HW12 - API

This is homework about working with API, using libraries `request` and `beautifulsoup4`. This directory contains repositories for two projects, one for `github` - accessing some GitHub user informtion, and the other one for [tblastn](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=tblastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome). Please see each directory for further description.
