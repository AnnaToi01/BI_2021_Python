Numpy arrays
=========
The numpy_challenge.py lets you operate on mathematical matrices, the functions include:
1. Matrix multiplication
2. Multiplication check
3. Multiply matrices
4. Compute 2d distance
5. Compute multidimensional distance
6. Compute pair distance
7. Compute length of vector
8. Transpose
9. Conjugate transpose

User interface is only available for real number matrices. Here, first you should enter the command and then the matrix, with rows separated by semicolons and columns separated by commas. Functions 1, 2, 3, 8 and 9 are also availble for matrices with complex numbers and can be used separately. No built-in numpy functions have been used for calculation of the listed functions for exercise purposes.
